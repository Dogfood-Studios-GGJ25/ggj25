## Vision
A slow decent into deep ocean accompanied by ...

## MDA
### Fear
- Environment progressively getting darker
- Sound FX suggesting large animals hunting for you
- Music emphasising the ambiance
- Never hit by big fish, but the wake disturbs your bubble

### Challenge
- Air bubble shrinking over time
- Saving air to prevent the bubble shrinkage
- Fish attacking
- Avoid Fish

## Controls
- arrow-keys, y-axis inverted

## Enemies
- Small fish, just nibble, don't really hurt you
- Big Fish, megalodon coming very close, disturbing you with their wake
- Sea horse - great white combo (great white size, teeth and red mouth) actually eats you
