A slow decent into deep ocean accompanied by ...

### UI
Diegetic, no explicit UI
- Air bubble size shows amount of air
- Enemies have clear, direct response to the flashlight

## MDA
### Fear
- Environment progressively getting darker
- Sound FX suggesting large animals hunting for you
- Music emphasising the ambiance
- Never hit by big fish, but the wake disturbs your bubble
	- Big eyes ogling you at the end
- Slow decent into the depth

### Challenge
- Air bubble shrinking over time
- Saving air to prevent the bubble shrinkage
	- holding breath, leads to hallucination and diminished vision by vignette

- Fish attacking
- Avoid Fish
- loud flashlight to scare enemies
	- loudness attracts enemies
	- enemies get scared away when in the light
- Uncommon controls

- You encounter rocks now and then
	- sometimes they have eyes

## Items
